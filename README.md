# VLADY's FiveM Projects

Welcome to my collection of FiveM projects! Below you'll find a brief overview of each project along with relevant information.

## Project 1: _Better Vehicle Control_
Description: A made-by-me Vehicle Control UI inspired by [Car control menu v3](https://fivemscript.store/collections/all/products/car-control-menu-v3).

### Features
- Cool Looking design
- Working buttons (almost all, not full release yet)
- Unique Design
- Vehicle Control
- Neons Control
- Vehicle Information Display

### Installation
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Copy it to vehicleControl
3. Go to your server.cfg and `ensure vehicleControl`
4. Head in-game -> get in a car -> Press `Z` and voila!

## Known Bugs
1. If shutting down the headlights from the control, they won't turn on by the `H` key anymore until re-enabled from the UI.
2. Windows & Neons not currently working (Wait for updates or contribute!).
3. Not having a `diabled` option for seats that you can't move to.
4. Fuel indicator for some reason is inverted in-game ðŸ¤”.

## IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ
Since this is a beta phase, you will get the React Project (UI raw files), you would need to start it in order to work. Meaning that you have to `npm start` it before launching the game.
